Lee Hammock Ñ Father, Business Owner, Clinically Diagnosed Self-Aware Narcissist
After having coffee with Lee Hammock on a couple of occasions after finding him on YouTube, this last time he agreed to do a video where he goes into some very common questions alienated parents ask. With all I've been through and all I know about those with Narcissist Personality Disorder (NPD) and/or Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), it has been quite the experience hearing the perspective of someone who has been properly diagnosed with Narcissist Personality Disorder (NPD) who is both wired this way and aware of his own condition first-hand. Lee says that his experience of those he talks to and works with are, like any other population, on a spectrum of sorts. Some with this condition will likely never have the ability to deal with it or choose not to. But, that's not true for everyone. That said, I haven't heard him say anything about treating someone who has this type of wiring any differently than the competent experts recommend we do. For me though, it's been different hearing it from a source. To me, Mr. HammockÕs transparency is at times very validating, other times sad, and others alarmingÑall of which seem to be a fundamental part of being in the presence of real truth. 

For example, this is from recent text message exchange: 
Me: OMG! ITÕS THE MONSTER IN THE BASEMENT!! Oh waitÑnever mindÑitÕs just a business owner from the next town over (laughing emoji) 
Lee: LOL! 
Lee pauses for a moment and then says: He can be both. (With laughing emoji)

Questions I asked him for this video and his answers:
YouÕre a WHAT? Why are you doing this?
WhatÕs it like being a parent with NPD?
How do you co-parent with a Narcissist?
WhatÕs the BEST way to be a good parent in this situation?
WhatÕs the best way to deal with a Narcissist in Court?
Where can I find out more?
