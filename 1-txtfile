Five Ways Family Courts Have Improved Addressing Parental Alienation Since 2015
Please take a moment to read the post and remember the context from which I write, someone who has gone through years of post Ã‘divorce headaches, going from my child almost never seeing their father to living with him 50% of the time. It is vital we take stock of any progress over time so we can build on it.
As I continue my own battles, which is at this time includes appealing a judge's bad decisions, this is a reminder for all of us that while there is still a long way to go. Here are 5 things that have gotten better in family court concerning parental alienation since 2015:
1.	More lawyers have experience dealing with parental alienation cases, so it's easier to find someone who can help you navigate the legal system.
2.	There are more resources available both in person and online than ever before for those who cannot afford a lawyer or don't know anyone who can help them.
3.	Among the many experts who have emerged, Dr. Craig Childress, PsyD is a leading expert on parental alienation and his work has helped many families understand their situation better and develop strategies to move forward using clear verifiable criteria.
4.	The courts are more aware of the signs of parental alienation and how to handle these cases appropriately.
5.	There is an increased focus on the best interests of the child when making decisions about custody and visitation rights, which helps ensure that children are not used as pawns in disputes between parents.
Remember, whether you have a lawyer, use one in a limited capacity, or are unrepresented, there are plenty of people out there willing to help you get started and provide support along the way! Don't be afraid to reach out for assistance - you don't have to go through this alone!
